The benchmark is just static resources (JS/CSS/images), so you can host it on any web server with a minimum of configuration.
The included HTML pages log timings for the loading milestones that Facebook cares about (time-to-interactive, display done, end-to-end) using console.log().
The benchmark is not official or necessarily representative, itâ€™s just a static snapshot of a test user's newsfeed instrumented with timings.

See the README in the deploying_locally/ directory for how to run this benchmark in your local environment.
