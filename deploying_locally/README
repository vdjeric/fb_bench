The benchmark is just static resources (JS/CSS/images), so you can host it on any web server with a minimum of configuration.
The included HTML pages log timings for the loading milestones that Facebook cares about (time-to-interactive, display done, end-to-end) using console.log().

TO SETUP THE BENCHMARK:
============================

How to replicate my web server setup from scratch

1. Create a 200MB ramdisk using the attached ramdisk.sh script: ./ramdisk.sh create 200
  - Note that you want to use this script or a similar command because you need to create a case-sensitive filesystem
  - Extract the static resources from the ZIP file into /Volumes/ramdisk/
  You don't want to just clone the repo because the inline paths are different and reference github.io

2. Set up nginx:
  - Install nginx, and use the attached nginx.conf file
  - Copy the self-signed .crt and .key certificate files into the same directory as the nginx.conf file (or create your own certs)

3. Set up OS environment:
  - Register the self-signed certs with the OS: sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain fb-benchmark.crt
  - Edit /etc/hosts to have "fb-benchmark" resolve to your server’s IP, then “sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder” to pick up the host file changes

These steps are all optional. The ramdisk is to reduce noise, and I found that serving the files over https actually influences whether Chrome caches bytecode or not. Faking a facebook.com domain is extremely hard, so I wouldn’t recommend trying that, hence my choice of “fb-benchmark:8443”.

TO RUN THE BENCHMARKS:
============================

- Simply load https://fb-benchmark:8443/newsfeed_bench.htm to collect facebook newsfeed load time metrics in the DevTools console
- There is also a smaller sub-test at https://fb-benchmark:8443/comments_bench.htm that measures the rendering time of the Facebook comments component (mostly React execution time). The render time is logged in the DevTools console

This is a v1 of a static benchmark, so let me know how it goes (vdjeric@fb.com) and if you have any suggestions for future directions.
